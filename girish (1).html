        <p>
          The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts more than 6 million visitors a year[3] and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.
          The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal

        <p class="p">
          Charminar, (Urdu: “Four Minarets”) historic monument located at the heart of Hyderabad, west-central Telangana state, south-central India. The city, which is the capital of both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states, was also the capital of the historic princely state of Hyderabad.
          The monument was built in 1591 by Muḥammad Qulī Quṭb Shah, the fifth king of the Quṭb Shāhī dynasty, reportedly as the first building in Hyderabad, his new capital. Over the years, it has become a signature monument to and an iconic symbol of the city’s heritage. According to one legend, the Hyderabad region was reeling from a devastating plague at the time that Muḥammad Qulī Quṭb Shah was shifting his capital from nearby Golconda to the new city. He commemorated the end of the plague by building a mosque, which became known as Charminar because of its four towering and distinctive minarets, one on each of the building’s four corners. It formed the centrepiece around which Hyderabad was planned.

        <h2 align="center"><u>Mysore Palace</u> </h2>
        <p>
          Mysore Palace also known as Amba Vilas Palace located at the heart of Mysore city is the most prominent tourist destination of Mysore that attracts millions of visitors round the year. This historical palace housed within the Old Fort facing the Chamunda Hills stands as the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty who ruled the Kingdom of Mysore from 1399 to 1950. Displaying Indo-Saracenic style of architecture, this sprawling building is a replacement of the old wooden building destroyed by fire in late 19th century. Commissioned by the Krishnarajendra Wadiyar IV, this palatial building comprises of two durbar halls, a number of colossal courtyards, buildings and strikingly beautiful gardens that speak volumes of the splendour of the Wadiyars.
          The Wodeyars whose roots trace back to Dv?rak?, Gujarat’s Yadava community came to Karnataka and settled in Mysore getting enthralled by its natural beauty. Starting with Yaduraya Wodeyar who founded the Wodeyar dynasty in 1399, the Yadavas ruled the area for around six centuries. He was first to build a palace within Mysore’s Old Fort in the 14th century, but that was dismantled and built several times later.

Among the most famous structures of the complex are the Hall of Public Audience (Diwan-i-ʿAm), which has 60 red sandstone pillars supporting a flat roof, and the Hall of Private Audience (Diwan-i-Khas), which is smaller and has a pavilion of white marble.

An earlier red fort had been built in Old Delhi in the 11th century by the Tomara king Anangapala. The Quṭb Mosque now stands on the site.
